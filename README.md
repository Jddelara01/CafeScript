In this section, I will be going through the different parts of the website and I will provide descriptions for each feature and what the feature do.

### Current Features

- _Navigation Bar_
    - Displayed at the very top of almost all of the pages of the website (except in the signup page) to help users navigate throught the site easily.
    - A site user can click on the any links of the navigation bar and it would bring them to the page that they clicked on. The navigation bar helps site users navigate through each page from all devices without having to use the "back" button to revert back to a previous page.
    - A link in the navigation bar will be underline and all letters will be uppercased once the user is on that specific page, this will help user identify which page he/she is currently in.
